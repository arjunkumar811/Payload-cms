###  **Document: CMS Integration Plan and Project Sections Overview**

####  **Objective:**

Before making any code changes, it's important to clearly understand:

* How we’ll get content from the CMS.
* What sections the frontend will include.
* How the frontend, backend, and CMS will work together.

---

###  **What is CMS and Why Are We Using It?**

A **CMS (Content Management System)** allows non-developers (like content managers or clients) to easily add, update, or delete content like blog posts, banners, FAQs, testimonials, etc., without touching the code.

We'll use a **Headless CMS** (like Sanity, Strapi, Contentful, or similar) — which means:

* It stores all the content.
* We fetch that content via an API.
* The frontend displays this dynamic content.

---

###  **How We Will Get Content from CMS**

1. **Setup CMS:**

   * Choose a Headless CMS (e.g., Sanity, Strapi).
   * Create models/schemas for each section like `Hero`, `Features`, `Blog`, etc.
   * Add real content via the CMS dashboard.

2. **Expose APIs:**

   * The CMS will provide REST or GraphQL APIs.
   * These APIs return JSON data for each section.

3. **Frontend Fetching:**

   * In the frontend (React/Next.js), we will fetch content using `fetch()` or a library like `axios`.
   * The content will be pulled dynamically using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` (if using Next.js).
   * We’ll use SWR or React Query if we need real-time content updates or caching.

4. **Backend (Optional Layer):**

   * If any extra processing or transformation is needed, we can have a custom backend (Node.js/Express/Next.js API routes) as a middleware between the frontend and CMS.

###  **Sections to Be Created and Mapped from CMS**

Here’s a breakdown of sections and their CMS structure:

| Section Name         | CMS Schema/Model | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hero Section**     | `heroSection`    | Heading, subheading, background image, CTA buttons |
| **Features Section** | `features`       | List of features (title, icon, description)        |
| **About Section**    | `about`          | Image, text, vision/mission                        |
| **Services**         | `services`       | Cards with service name, description, icon/image   |
| **Blog**             | `blogPosts`      | Title, content, thumbnail, author, date            |
| **Testimonials**     | `testimonials`   | User name, avatar, feedback, rating                |
| **FAQ Section**      | `faq`            | Question and answer format                         |
| **Footer**           | `footer`         | Contact info, social links, copyright              |

Each of these will be:

* Created as a separate model in the CMS.
* Filled with actual content.
* Pulled into the frontend as a JSON object.

###  **Frontend-Backend-CMS Architecture**

```
   CMS (e.g., Sanity, Strapi)
         ↓  (via REST/GraphQL API)
     Backend (Optional, if processing is needed)
         ↓
     Frontend (Next.js/React)
         ↓
     UI Components render the content
```

---

###  **Benefits of This Setup**

* Content can be updated without code changes.
* Reusable and modular components in frontend.
* Fast development and clean separation of concerns.
* Easy maintenance for developers and content managers.

---

###  **Next Steps Before Coding**

1. Finalize CMS platform (Sanity/Strapi/etc.).
2. Define CMS schemas for all required sections.
3. Map each CMS schema with a frontend component.
4. Test fetching content using mock APIs.
5. Only then — begin integrating into the actual UI.
